# MNIST Digit Recognition

An implementation of digit recognition using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a simple neural network model for recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network for this classification task.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
- Creates a simple neural network model.
- Compiles and trains the model on the dataset.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-recognition.git
   cd mnist-digit-recognition
